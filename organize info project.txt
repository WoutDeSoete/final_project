connection manager: PLAB3
	log-events sent too the logger
	gets data from sensors (TCP) 
	write this data too buffer
	
data manager:PLAB1
	read data from buffer instead of file
	still does running average, too hot/cold
	sends too hot/cold to logger, or if sensor data is invalid

storage manager:PLAB2
	log events sent too the logger
	read data from buffer put it in data.csv file( "w" because new when program rerun)
	
logger:PLAB2
	receives data from all different threads via pipe
	still child of the main process
	writes messages from pipe to gateway.log
	gateway.log("w" because new when program rerun)
	
shared data:PLAB4 
	connection manager == writer thread
	data manager == reader thread
	storage manager == reader thread
	


logs to be supported:
1.	connection manager:
2.		sensor node <ID> has opened a new connection
3.		sensor node <ID> has closed the connection
4.	Data manager:
5.		sensor node <ID> reports it is too cold
6.		sensor node <ID> reports it is too hot
7.		Received sensor data with invalid sensor node ID <ID>
8.	storage manager:
9.		a new data.csv file has been created
10.		Data insertion from sensor <ID> succeeded
11.		the data.csv file has been closed
