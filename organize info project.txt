connection manager: PLAB3 (connmgr.c)
	W log-events sent to the logger
	V gets data from sensors (TCP) 
	W write this data too buffer
		
data manager:PLAB1 (datamgr.c)
	W read data from buffer instead of file
	W still does running average, too hot/cold
	W sends too hot/cold to logger, or if sensor data is invalid

storage manager:PLAB2 (sensor_db.c)
	W log events sent too the logger
	W read data from buffer put it in data.csv file( "w" cause new when program rerun)
	
logger:PLAB2 (main.c)
	W receives data from all different threads via pipe
	V still child of the main process
	V writes messages from pipe to gateway.log
	V gateway.log("w" because new when program rerun)
	
shared data:PLAB4 (sbuffer.c)
	W connection manager == writer thread
	W data manager == reader thread
	W storage manager == reader thread
	


logs to be supported:
1.	connection manager:
2.		sensor node <ID> has opened a new connection
3.		sensor node <ID> has closed the connection
4.	Data manager:
5.		sensor node <ID> reports it is too cold
6.		sensor node <ID> reports it is too hot
7.		Received sensor data with invalid sensor node ID <ID>
8.	storage manager:
9.		a new data.csv file has been created
10.		Data insertion from sensor <ID> succeeded
11.		the data.csv file has been closed

works but mem loss: 	sbuffer insert, connection manager
			logger_loop
